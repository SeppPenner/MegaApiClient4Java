MegaApiClient4Java
====================================

MegaApiClient4Java is a library for using https://mega.nz/ with Java.
The reference project for .Net can be found here: https://github.com/gpailler/MegaApiClient
The library is not finished (and will probably never be finished).
The original idea was to transform https://github.com/gpailler/MegaApiClient to Java code.
Well, it's not thaaat easy...
For those who are interested, this project can be copied and modified as you like.
